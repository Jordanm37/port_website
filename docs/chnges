Title: List-first, monochrome, stochastic signature

Goal
Design a writing-first site for an AI/physics engineer focused on modelling, evaluation, understanding, and optimisation of stochastic systems across domains (physics, LLMs, RL). Home equals the Writing index with a short bio at the top. Keep Projects and About (with Services folded in). Header includes a Contact button (booking) and a quiet Hire me link to a consulting site.

Structure and navigation

- Home = /writing (index shows on the root). Short bio at top, then the post list.
- Header: Writing · Projects · About. Right side: Contact button (booking), Hire me link, theme toggle, RSS.
- About page includes a Services section with a single external button to the consulting site.

Typography and rhythm

- Typeface: Inter for UI/prose, JetBrains Mono for code.
- Body: 1.15rem font size, 1.65 line height; prose max-width ~72ch for 50–75 characters per line.
- Headings set with clamp():
  - H1: clamp(2.6rem, 4vw + 1rem, 3.2rem)
  - H2: clamp(2.0rem, 2.5vw + 1rem, 2.3rem)
  - H3: clamp(1.5rem, 1.2vw + 1rem, 1.7rem)
- Sentence case headings. Use tabular numerals for dates, equation numbers, and metrics.

Colour and theme

- Monochrome base (bg, surface, text, muted, border) with one spectral accent reserved for uncertainty fills and selection states.
- Light and dark themes. Meet WCAG AA for body and large type.

Home / writing index visuals

- Date (natural form, e.g., “5 September 2025”) + read time + optional series pill in a left meta rail.
- Main column: title and one-line dek.
- Desktop shows a 16:9 thumbnail on the right; hide thumbnails on mobile.
- Filters: Tag and Series. No search box.
- Show RSS and JSON Feed links near the filters.

Post page visuals

- Layout: H1 → meta row (natural date · read time · tags) → top progress bar.
- Sticky table of contents at ≥1280 px; hidden below that width.
- Code blocks: Shiki highlight, copy button, language label.
- Maths: KaTeX. Support footnotes and figure captions. Allow full-bleed diagrams where marked.
- Related posts (3) at the end.

Physics / UQ signature

- Seeded SVG masthead under the title per post. Kinds: Perlin, Brownian, OU, GP. Seed = slug for deterministic fingerprints.
  - Perlin factoid (use as a small aside once): Perlin noise (Ken Perlin, early 1980s) shaped film CGI and video-game terrain; it gives natural structure without grid artefacts.
- Assumption inspector panel near the top of each post:
  - Fields: noise model, priors, solver, uncertainty type chips (Aleatoric, Epistemic) with one-line tooltips.
- Uncertainty bands as first-class visuals (fan charts for intervals). Use the spectral accent for interval fills.
- Sparklines in the margin for residuals/score traces. Equation numbers in the gutter via CSS counters.

Components, states, and motion

- Links keep underlines with increased offset and thickness.
- Focus ring on every interactive element: 2px outline with 3px offset.
- Cards and list rows use hairline borders, 10–12px radius, and light elevation.
- Motion set low: 120–180ms hovers, small card lift, underline offset shift on link hover.

Projects log visuals

- Research-style list grouped by organisation or theme.
- Show client/employer names when permitted.
- Each item shows role/period, short scope, technique chips inside the project page, artefacts (code/talk/demo/paper), and links back to related posts.

Discoverability and share

- Dynamic OG images for posts and projects.
- RSS, Atom, and JSON feeds. Sitemap.
- Theme toggle visible. Include a skip link and full keyboard path through all controls.

Anti-goals

- No separate Notes section; short notes live in the unified Writing stream.
- No method chips on Writing cards.
- No free-text search.

Content model (front matter shape)

- Post
  - title
  - dek
  - tags[]
  - series (optional)
  - published (ISO date renders as natural)
  - readingTime (minutes)
  - masthead: "perlin" | "brownian" | "ou" | "gp"
  - assumptions:
    - noise
    - priors
    - solver
    - uncertainty: ["aleatoric","epistemic"]

Visual tokens (OKLCH sketch)

- Define: --bg, --surface, --text, --muted, --border
- Accent: one spectral hue used for interval bands and selected states
- Keep AA contrast in default and focus/hover states across light and dark

Layout rules

- List row (desktop): grid 120px | 1fr | 240px; gap 16px; border-bottom 1px; padding 16px 0.
- Mobile: single column; hide thumbnail.
- Prose container: max-width 72ch; grids use 1100–1200px on wide screens.

Interactivity

- JS widgets for small experiments: Monte Carlo sliders that update FanChart; re-seed buttons for OU/Brownian paths.
- Python route for selected posts: JupyterLite/Pyodide cells with numpy/scipy preloaded. Seed from URL for reproducible runs.

Acceptance checks

- Home shows bio then the writing list, date-first, with read time and series pills where present.
- Desktop thumbnails render, mobile hides them.
- Progress bar, sticky TOC (≥1280 px), Shiki, KaTeX, footnotes all present on posts.
- Assumption inspector renders the four fields with tooltips. Masthead uses the slug seed.
- Focus styles visible on all controls; links underlined; AA contrast passes.
- RSS/Atom/JSON links visible on the index; sitemap shipped.## Comprehensive v0 prompt for your stochastic systems portfolio

readingTime: 10
masthead: "perlin"
assumptions:
  noise: "Ornstein-Uhlenbeck"
  priors: "Γ(α=2, β=1) on diffusion"

  uncertainty: ["aleatoric", "epistemic"]
```

ANTI-PATTERNS TO AVOID:

- No gradient backgrounds or neon effects
- No particle animations or WebGL
- No method chips on writing list cards
- No separate Notes section
- No free-text search box
- No comments section
- No social media icons
- No loading spinners (use skeleton states)
- No modal dialogs (use pages)
- No infinite scroll

The final result should feel like reading a well-typeset research paper combined with the clarity of Observable notebooks, maintaining academic rigour while being technically sophisticated through thoughtful simplicity rather than visual excess.
