summary: "Quick harness to diff prompt variants with paired judgments."

Plan: paired eval on (A,B) prompts with the same seed set; score with rubric and shortjust.

```ts
type Judgment = { pass: boolean; reason: string };
export async function judge(output: string): Promise<Judgment> {
  // placeholder rubric; swap with LLM-as-judge
  return { pass: /grounded|citation/.test(output), reason: "checks groundedness" };
}
```
